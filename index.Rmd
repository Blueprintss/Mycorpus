Introduction
=======================================================================

### Introduction to My Corpus

My Corpus is about the Loudness War, by using big data I'm wondering if the loudness from tracks really peaked during the Loudnesswar and if with the normalization tools from streaming services nowadays, the loudness from songs decreases again. I choose this, because i really hated the loudness war since my ear fatiqued way sooner and music was just flat. I really hope to find some proof that nowadays the loudnass war is finally ending.
				
My comparison points are from the Loudness factor of the spotify database, In which i will compare the output of the different decennia with the development of the loudness war.
				The representation is only limited by the amount of data it covers, since im not able to track all the music in the world i will pick the All out Playlist from the 70-10s to make my case. 

My expectation is that the relative loudness wil decline at the same time that streaming services started to gain a lot of members. Since all the streaming services use normalization (every song is equally loud), and with that their isn't any beneficial factor left for making a song sheer loud. I suspect producers will focus again on quality and impact.

At the same time i will look at the music of my favorite band The Red Hot Chili Peppers, since they have produced albums since the 80s, I would be interesting to see if they have followed the Loudness trend.


Loudness War {data-navmenu=Background}
===========================================================================

### Background Loudness War

The Loudness War refers to a trend in music production where songs are made as loud as possible, often at the expense of dynamic range and sound quality. This is achieved through the use of various compression and limiting techniques that increase the volume of a recording, which can make it sound more aggressive and powerful.

The goal of the Loudness War is to make a song stand out on the radio or in a playlist, where louder songs are more likely to catch the listener's attention. However, this pursuit of loudness has led to the overuse of these techniques, which can result in distortion, loss of detail, and listener fatigue.

While loudness can be effective in some contexts, such as in rock or electronic music, it can also detract from the emotional impact of a song, and make it sound more monotonous or tiresome over time. As a result, many music professionals and fans advocate for a return to more natural, dynamic sound production, and for musicians to prioritize the quality and impact of their music over sheer volume.

### Notes

As seen in the graph spotify started to take off in the end of the 00s. At the same time we see a massive decline in Sales for CD's. This suggest a correlation. I get back on this in the conclusion.

### Notes

I choose to make 2 cepstrograms, since my corpus is so loudness based the c01 (loudness factor) is the obivious most interseting factor to focus on here. As explained in the background the loudnesswar has an influence on the dynamic range. This is very good visible in these examples :

The song Snow from 2006 has a lot of homogenity in the c01 factor which respresents the same loudness trough the entire song, apart form the intro en end..

On the other hand the song Under The Bridge from 1991 is very different. The c01 from this graph is obviously more different throughout the entire song, which snow a lot of dynamic range thourgh the entire song.

These observations perfecly align with my hypotheses.

Discussion {data-navmenu=Conclusion}
=======================================================================

One thing what really influences this research is the influence of remasters. For example Smooth Criminial from Michael Jackson in the playlist is an Remaster. Sadly more often than not the orignial master isn't available on spotify. So the original data is not always available for this research. Understandle enough this makes the research less of a representation than wished for.
