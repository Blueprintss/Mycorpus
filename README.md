# Mycorpus
My Corpus file for the Computational Musicology Course
				
				My Corpus is about the Loudness War, by using big data I'm wondering if the dynamic range form tracks really decreased during the Loudnesswar and if with the normalization tools from streaming services nowadays, the dynmaic range from songs exacty incresases again. I choose this, because i really hated the loudness war since my ear fatiqued way sooner and music was just flat. I really hope to find some proof that nowadays the loudnass war is finally ending.
				My comparison points are the dynmaic range from albums and tracks from the 90's and 00's and compare them with 60's en 10 en 20's tracks.
				The represantion is only limited by the amount of data it covers, since im not able to track all the music in the world i will mainy focus on Rock. From Dire Straits to Sum41 to Royal Blood
